# Powerup-Platforms: I'm eager to showcase the application I've developed using the MS Power Platform, which effectively addresses real-world business needs.
As a former Microsoft employee, I had an amazing experience exploring all the tools and programs. 

Business Scenario: A charity focused on animal rescue operates animal shelters and collaborates with local families to provide foster care for animals in need. The organization seeks to enhance its record-keeping system for animals housed in shelters and foster homes.

If you're interested in exploring low-code development and considering a career change, the Microsoft Power Up program could offer a valuable opportunity.
